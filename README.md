# Window OS
Hey everyone, I'm Candy. Here, I proudly present to you my masterpiece, the Y2K OS. It's a webOS ispired by this [hackclub tutorial](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS).

## How to Use
Y2K OS will have a loading screen, and after that, it will start the whole thing. A welcome.txt will appear. It can be later accesed via the 'my files' app. To open an app, you could just click on one and it'll open. And to open files you can double click them in the file explorer.

### Easter Egg
If you switch your settings of year to 2000, you'll see some errors and then you'll be greeted with fireworks and an end screen. The idea of this is from the Y2K bug, also the name of this webOS.

### Bugs you may Encounter
So, the I hosted the chat thing on Render, so it may get inactive and won't work sometimes, but get patient and the server would probably work after some time.
