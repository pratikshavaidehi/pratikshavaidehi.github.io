You're Going to Love Tokyo
Japan’s capital city is massive, with over 13 million people, but that doesn’t create an overpowering atmosphere. Instead, Tokyo is one of the world’s friendliest, most welcoming capitals, with an array of neighborhoods just waiting for visitors to explore.
For food lovers, Tokyo is paradise. Everyday, you can try a different world-class sushi restaurant and enjoy the delicious creations of expert chefs at places like Sukiyabashi Jiro and Sushi-sho.

There’s also an almost infinite variety of gaming arcades, and every aspect of video game history is represented. You can play 1980s consoles at Super Potato or try the very latest games in the Akihabara district.

Visit tranquil shrines, relax in exquisite Japanse gardens, learn about the nation’s history and art, and shop until you can’t shop anymore in Shibuya or Ginza. There’s something for everyone in this pulsating, exciting capital that is truly one of the world’s great cities.
